# Step 1: Hello World Application with Express (Node.js) and Bootstrap

This step covers the creation of a simple Hello World web application using Express (Node.js) and Bootstrap. The application serves a single "Hello World" page with basic Bootstrap styling.

## Description

The Hello World application is built using Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js. It consists of a minimal web server that serves a single "Hello World" page with basic Bootstrap styling.

- Express is used to create the web server and define the route for serving the "Hello World" page.
- Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, is used to style the "Hello World" page and make it more presentable.

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the Express server by running:

```bash
node app.js
```


5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the "Hello World" page styled with Bootstrap.

You can modify the `public/index.html` file to make changes to the "Hello World" page. If you need to add more routes or functionality, you can update the `app.js` file accordingly.
